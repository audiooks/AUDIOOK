00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
When British roads threatened the hills of the Kasi, Yutarat Singh chose to defend his

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.000
people's land and freedom.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.360
Yutarat Singh was a Kasi chief who lived at a time when British expansion began to press

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.080
against tribal autonomy in the hills.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.080
The immediate flashpoint was a proposed road and new outposts that threatened ancestral

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.640
grazing areas and sacred sites.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.360
Tarat Singh used diplomacy at first, but when petitions failed he organized his people to

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.000
resist construction and protect movement routes between villages.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.640
Fighting in hills is different from open plains, tactics emphasized ambush, long withdrawal

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.960
into narrow passes, and avoiding pitched battle with better armed troops.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.160
Tarat coordinated neighboring Kasi groups and Allied Hill communities, using knowledge

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.160
of passes and seasonal weather to hinder British supply lines.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.640
Local lore remembers him riding ahead of his men, warning villages and cutting communication

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.880
lines at night.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.200
Capture came as the British redoubled efforts, combining local informants, better supplies

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.920
and reinforcements.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.160
Tarat was eventually taken from the field and moved to colonial custody.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.240
He died in captivity, but his resistance remained important in Kasi memory, a clear example

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.880
of local leaders defending customary rights against the encroachment of a distant power.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.880
His story is taught in the hills as a lesson in defending local institutions and the values

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.520
of self-rule.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.360
For later generations, Yutarat Singh's name stands both for localized resistance and for

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.520
the costs communities paid in the long series of colonial expansions.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.400
In captivity, his spirit remained unbroken, a symbol of the hills defiance.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.840
