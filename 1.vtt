00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
This is a true fact in Assam's history that started revolt against British long before the revolt of 1857.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.400
In a land reshaped by foreign rule, one young leader chose courage over silence.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.720
In the years after the first Anglo-Bermes war the old structures of power in Assam were shaken.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.640
By 1828 new taxes, changes in administration, and the steady presence of British officials had angered many communities.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.720
Ghamdar Khanwar, a young member of the Aham household, watched his people's rights and local leaders being pushed aside.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.520
He gathered friends and farmers who had lost land or livelihoods and began to speak of restoring dignity and local rule.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.080
The uprising began quietly, secret meetings at dusk, messages carried along river paths,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.840
and a small band of men who were willing to take back stores and weapons from poorly guarded outposts.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:58.640
Ghamdar avoided grand speeches, he urged practical action, seized supplies, free imprisoned villagers, and refused to pay unjust dues.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.280
Word spread quickly from village to village.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.640
For a brief, intense period the band struck the symbols of British power with surprising speed.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.840
The British response was swift.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.640
Troops moved in from the nearest garrison, in skirmishes followed.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.840
Outgunned and under supplied, the local force could not sustain a long conventional fight.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.840
Ghamdar and his followers fought bravely in bamboo groves and narrow paths where knowledge of terrain briefly turned the odds.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.680
Eventually Ghamdar was captured during a night raid, tried by colonial officers, and imprisoned.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.320
The movement dispersed under pressure, but stories of that winter night lingered.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.960
For villagers and later historians, Ghamdar Khanwar's uprising became more than a failed revolt.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.600
It was a remembered stand that kept alive the idea that local people would not accept total subjugation without resistance.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.840
Ghamdar Khanwar's stand proved that even a brief spark can light the path for generations.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.360
