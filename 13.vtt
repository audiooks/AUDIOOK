00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
In the early 1900s, when Bengal's youth dreamed of freedom, Kudiram Bose dared to turn that

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.080
dream into action.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.560
Kudiram Bose grew up in a Bengal where ideas of self-rule and revolutionary societies spread

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.320
among young people.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.880
Barely into his teens he was drawn to underground networks that distributed pamphlets, raised

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.600
funds and plotted acts meant to jolt colonial administration.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.800
The turning moment came in 1908 when a planned attack targeted a British magistrate who represented

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.480
those repressive courts.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.960
Kudiram and a small team took part in an attempt that ended tragically, wrongly targeted in

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.680
one account, bravely faced in another, but in the aftermath he was arrested, tried and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.880
given the harshest colonial punishment, death.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.180
He was hardly 20, yet his courage struck a court across regions where youths were looking

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.080
for models of resistance.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.200
What made Kudiram significant was not merely the single violent act but the way he embodied

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.400
youthful commitment to freedom.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.960
His letters, trial testimony and the memory of his final days became powerful narratives

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.600
in nationalist circles, a teenager willing to sacrifice himself for what he saw as his

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.200
country's dignity.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.240
After his execution he became, quickly, both a martyr and a rallying figure for many revolutionary

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.720
groups who used his example to inspire recruits.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.720
For later generations Kudiram Bose remains a symbol of young courage and the extreme

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.640
choices colonial repression drove some into, a reminder of how deeply the fight for independence

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.320
reached into the lives of ordinary youths.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.720
Barely 20, he faced the gallows with a smile, leaving behind a legacy of fearless youth.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.160
