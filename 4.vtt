00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In the dense forests of Bagulpur, a Santhal leader named Tilka Manjee rose to defend his people's land and dignity.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Tilka Manjee belonged to the Santhal community in the Bagulpur region where customary land rights and forest access had sustained families for generations.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
By the late 1700s the East India Company's revenue demands and outsider land claims disrupted these rhythms.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Outraged, Tilka rose as a leader who could read both the forest paths and the resentment of his people.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
He organized vans of Santhal hunters and cultivators into mobile groups that could strike quickly and vanish into the woods.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Their weapons were bows, spears and intimate knowledge of terrain, not the muskets of the company, but advantaged through surprise and unity.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In several daring attacks local British officers were wounded and supplies seized to feed families that had been stripped by taxes.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The company responded with a combination of punitive expeditions and promises, but the asymmetric nature of the conflict worked for a time in Tilka's favor.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
For the villagers his actions were both practical, a way to get food and arms, and symbolic, a refusal to accept loss of land and livelihood without fight.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Faced with overwhelming military resources and betrayed in one engagement, Tilka was captured, tried by colonial authorities, and executed.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Yet his story did not vanish.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
In tribal memory Tilka Manjee became a martyr, a clear example that resistance existed long before the larger national movements and that tribal communities had their own long struggle against exploitation.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Though he was executed, Tilka's courage blazed a trail of resistance that still inspires generations.
